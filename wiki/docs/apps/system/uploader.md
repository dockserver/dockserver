# Uploader
Automated uploader for Google Team Drive.</br>

### IMPORTANT
Each Uploader instance needs his own Project/Keys, never use keys from other projects.

### Features:
- Completely automated.
- Clean web interface.
- Support for encrypted Team Drives.
- Support for multiple Team Drives.
- Bypass daily upload limit of 750GB via Service Accounts.
- Support for [Autoscan](https://github.com/Cloudbox/autoscan).
- Full support for [Rclone's bandwidth limit](https://rclone.org/docs/#bwlimit-bandwidth-spec).
- Notifications via [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise).
- Variable concurrent uploads.
- Settings are refreshed for each upload. No need to restart the container after making a configuration change!
- Start and stop on demand via the container or web interface (active uploads are not considered when pausing via the web interface).

- Change time formatting.

    ![changetime](/img/uploader/changetime.gif)
    

### Limitations:
- No support for Google Drive.
- If using multiple Team Drives for Uploader, `FOLDER_DEPTH` must be identical across all drives.
- Bandwidth limit is *per* upload IE - If you have `TRANSFERS=2` and `BANDWIDTH_LIMIT=20M`, the maximum total upload speed would be 40MiB.
- Bandwidth cannot be changed for any active uploads.

### Exclude files from being uploaded
rclone.exclude is located here: `/opt/appdata/system/uploader/rclone.exclude`

Example:

- if you donÂ´t want that **srt** files are being uploaded, you have to add `.*\.srt$` to the file.
- You can exclude folders to, examples are in the file, because we already exclude certain folders.

## Configuration
All settings can be found here: `/opt/appdata/system/uploader/uploader.env`

#### USER VALUES
|Setting   |Default|Description|
|----------|-------|-----------|
|`PUID`    |`1000` |PGUID to be used by Uploader.|
|`PGID`    |`1000` |PGID to be used by Uploader.|
|`TIMEZONE`|`UTC`  |Timezone to be used by Uploader.|

#### CRITICAL SETUP FOR CRYPT USER
|Setting       |Default |Description|
|--------------|--------|-----------|
|`HASHPASSWORD`|`hashed`|If using `drive.csv` or `uploader.csv` and encrypted Team Drive, this must be set.</br>Options:</br>`hashed`</br>`plain`|

You have 2 options for this value `HASHPASSWORD`.

1. `hashed` this tells uploader that you have the encrypted password in your `drive.csv` or `uploader.csv`.

2. `plain` this tells uploader that you have the plain password in your `drive.csv` or `uploader.csv`.

You can leave the value as it is if you dont use Multi Drive uploading.

#### RCLONE - SETTINGS
|Setting          |Default         |Description|
|-----------------|----------------|-----------|
|`BANDWIDTH_LIMIT`|`null`          |The maximum upload speed *per upload*. Please refer to the [Rclone documentation](https://rclone.org/docs/#bwlimit-bandwidth-spec) before changes are made.|

### Multi-Drive Uploader
If you would like to upload to multiple Team Drives, you need to create a file named `uploader.csv` in `/opt/appdata/system/servicekeys/`. You can find a sample file in `opt/appdata/system/uploader/sample`. For each Team Drive, add a line in the `uploader.csv` file.

**IMPORTANT**: If "LOCAL_FOLDER_NAME" contains a hyphen, do not include it.
</br>
</br>

**Unencrypted Team Drives example:**

- 1 = LOCAL_FOLDER_NAME -> (TV)
- 2 = TEAM_DRIVE_ID -> (0AFsVct4HDKPrUk9PVvvvvvvvv)
#### Important: Each line in csv is one Local Folder
Example:
```yaml
TV|0AFsVct4HDKPrUk9PVvvvvvvvv
TV4K|0AFsVct4HDKPrUk9PVxxxxxxxxxx
Movies|0AFsVct4HDKPrUk9PVyyyyyyyyyy
Movies4K|0AFsVct4HDKPrUk9PVzzzzzzzzzz
appbackups|0AFsVct4HDKPrUk9PVzzzzzzzzzz
music|0AFsVct4HDKPrUk9PVzzzzzzzzzz
```

**Encrypted Team Drives example:**

- 1 = LOCAL_FOLDER_NAME -> (Movies)
- 2 = TEAM_DRIVE_ID -> (0AFsVct4HDKPrUk9PVvvvvvvvv)
- 3 = PASSWORD - <HASHED|PLAIN> -> (72nsjsiwjsjsu)
- 4 = PASSWORD SALT - <HASHED|PLAIN> -> (72nsjsiwjsjsu)
#### Important: Each line in csv is one Local Folder
Example:
```yaml
Movies|0AFsVct4HDKPrUk9PVvvvvvvvv|72nsjsiwjsjsu|72nsjsiwjsjsu
TV SHows|0AFsVct4HDKPrUk9PVxxxxxxxxxx|72nsjsiwjsjsu|72nsjsiwjsjsu
4K|0AFsVct4HDKPrUk9PVyyyyyyyyyy|72nsjsiwjsjsu|72nsjsiwjsjsu
TV 4K|0AFsVct4HDKPrUk9PVzzzzzzzzzz|72nsjsiwjsjsu|72nsjsiwjsjsu
appbackups|0AFsVct4HDKPrUk9PVzzzzzzzzzz|72nsjsiwjsjsu|72nsjsiwjsjsu
music|0AFsVct4HDKPrUk9PVzzzzzzzzzz|72nsjsiwjsjsu|72nsjsiwjsjsu
```

**IMPORTANT**: </br>
</br>
All Keys must be known on all Team Drives! </br>
You also have to add all folders where you want to upload files (even backup folders).

### Other Uploader Features
Instead of using `/opt/appdata/system/servicekeys/rclonegdsa.conf`, you can now use a `drive.csv` where you can put the default Team Drive to upload in. To make use of this feature, you need to create a file named `drive.csv` in `/opt/appdata/system/uploader/`.
</br>
</br>

#### Unencrypted Team Drives

- 1 = TEAM_DRIVE_NAME -> (uploader)
- 2 = TEAM_DRIVE_ID -> (0XXXXXXXXX000000EERR)
#### Important: Each line in csv is one tdrive
Example:

```yaml
uploader|0XXXXXXXXX000000EERR
```

#### Encrypted Team Drives

- 1 = TEAM_DRIVE_NAME -> (uploader)
- 2 = TEAM_DRIVE_ID -> (0XXXXXXXXX000000EERR)
- 3 = PASSWORD - HASHED OR PLAIN -> (72nsjsiwjsjsu)
- 4 = PASSWORD SALT - HASHED OR PLAIN -> (72nsjsiwjsjsu)
#### Important: Each line in csv is one tdrive
Example:
```yaml
uploader|0XXXXXXXXX000000EERR|72nsjsiwjsjsu|72nsjsiwjsjsu
