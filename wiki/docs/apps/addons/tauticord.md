# Tauticord

A Discord bot that displays live data from Tautulli

# Features

Tauticord uses the Tautulli API to pull information from Tautulli and display them in a Discord channel, including:

### OVERVIEW:

- Number of current streams
- Number of transcoding streams
- Total bandwidth
- Total LAN bandwidth

### FOR EACH STREAM:

- Stream state (playing, paused, stopped, loading)
- Media type (tv show/movie/song/photo)
- User
- Media title
- Product and player
- Quality profile
- Stream bandwidth
- If stream is transcoding
- Progress of stream
- ETA of stream completion

Administrator (the bot owner) can react to Tauticord's messages to terminate a specific stream (if they have Plex Pass).

Users can also indicate what libraries they would like monitored. Tauticord will create/update a voice channel for each library name with item counts every hour.
