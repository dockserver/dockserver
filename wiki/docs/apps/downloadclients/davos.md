davos is an FTP download automation tool that allows you to scan various FTP servers for files you are interested in. This can be used to configure file feeds as part of a wider workflow.

# Why use davos?

A fair number of services still rely on "file-drops" to transport data from place to place. A common practice is to configure a cron job to periodically trigger FTP/SFTP programs to download those files. _davos_ is relatively similar, only it also adds a web UI to the whole process, making the management of these schedules easier.
