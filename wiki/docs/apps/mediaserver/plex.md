# PLEX MEDIA SERVER

## INTRODUCTION

Plex gives you one place to find and access all the media that matters to you. From personal media on your own server, to free and on-demand Movies & Shows, live TV, podcasts, and web shows, to streaming music, you can enjoy it all in one app, on any device.

And, it’s really simple to start using…
First, if you are streaming only third-party content (Movies & Shows, live TV, podcasts, web shows, TIDAL music), then you are good to go as soon as you have an account, just install an app on your phone, Smart TV, computer, or simply open up our web app on your browser!
