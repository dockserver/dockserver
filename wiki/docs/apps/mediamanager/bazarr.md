# Bazarr

A good client for finding subtitles for your stuff.

This needs to be configured from bottom up, and an anti-captcha account is recommended but not mandatory

In order to get autoscan on picking up subs you can use this under "Custom post processing"

`curl -sG -X POST -u username:password --data-urlencode "dir={{directory}}" http://autoscan:3030/triggers/manual`

Here is a [heatmap](https://wiki.bazarr.media/bazarr-stats/ "heatmap") that the devs on bazarr made. Great inspiration if you're looking into which indexers to choose
