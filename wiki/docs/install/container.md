All Dockefiles are automatically generated 

Do not try to change anything live on the repository

All changes are made from our own CI Pipline ( unpublic ) 

---

We are out of the dev version.

All Containers can be used without breaking.

You can use all with dockserver

Don't use the images / dockers on other projects
This should not work for you.

1. We don't accept pull_request for other projects.

## Ideas and Code

This repository is heavily based on 

[Linuxserver.io](https://linuxserver.io) images and [k8s-at-home](https://k8s-at-home.com/) idea

All Containers have some additional edits just for dockserver.io

Please check before you run it on other systems
