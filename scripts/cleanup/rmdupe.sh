# Look at filenames in current directory and generate list with filename
# suffixes removed (a filename suffix is anything after the last dot in
# the file name). We assume filenames that does not contain newlines.
# Only unique prefixes will be generated.

# sample :
# bash rmdupe.sh Movies << MOVIES is $1 
# it's running without any separate yes/no action
